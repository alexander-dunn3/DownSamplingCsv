# DownSamplingCsv

This console app quite simply exists to help myself and others downsample csv files.

On running the console app a few inputs are required:
1) The csv path
2) The number of header rows to ignore during the downsampling routine (these rows are also preserved in the new file created)
3) The downsample ratio to use during the downsampling routine
